# This is a mapping containing known instrument positions and geometry.
#
# * East Latitude and North Longitude are given in degrees.
# * Altitude above mean sea level is in metres.
# * Rotation of the primary beam is degrees anti-clockwise looking down from
#   above (e.g. westward from north)
# * Roll of the cylinder(s) is degrees eastward from vertical, clockwise
#   looking North along the focal line.
# * Offset of the antenna zero-point is metres in the right-handed
#   tangent-space anchored at (lat,lon,alt):
#     * a positive X offset is eastward
#     * a positive Y offset is northward
#     * a positive Z offset is upward
#
# All parameters must be specified.  Malformed records will be
# ignored.

# Latitude, longitude and altitude from `ch_util.ephemeris`
# Rotations, rolls and offsets     from `ch_util.tools`

# The following comment has been extracted from `ch_util.tools`:
#
# Currently the position between the Pathfinder and 26m have been
# calibrated with holography, but positions between CHIME and
# Pathfinder/26m have not (they were determined from high-res
# satellite images and are only approximate).  We need to
# use CHIME holography data to constrain distance [x, y, z] between
# CHIME and 26m.  I then recommend defining our coordinate system
# such that center of CHIME array is the origin (so leaving variable
# chime.offset alone, and updating pathfinder.offset and galt.offset
# appropriately.)

# CHIME telescope at DRAO

# Calvin derived the horizontal position of the center of the focal lines...
# ...and the elevation of the focal line from survey coordinates:
